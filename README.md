# GameDesignProject
A small project completed over a few weeks for a game design course in 2017 (alongside 3 other developers)

Warning: This project was a bit of an experimental adventure with the Unity Game Engine, as such there's a lot in the source code I'm not particularly proud of. That said, it was a useful experience both in terms of the experience gained for future programming work and the mindset necessary to effectively work alongside other developers.
